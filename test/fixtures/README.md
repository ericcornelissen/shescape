# Text Fixtures

The _test fixtures_ (or _test vectors_) are a collection of examples of input
strings and how they can be escaped (and quoted) for safe usage as command line
arguments.

The test fixtures are licensed under the [`MPL-2.0`] license to promote sharing
when improvements are made to the fixtures.
