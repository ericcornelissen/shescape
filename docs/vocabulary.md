## Argument Splitting

_Argument splitting_ occurs when an input to a shell command unexpectedly
contains a space, thus introducing a new argument. The new argument may be
interpreted differently by the program, typically leading to unexpected failure
but sometimes also in security vulnerabilities.

The following is an example of this type of problem:

```javascript
import { execSync } from "node:child_process";

execSync(`npm --omit ${category} list`);
```

where the `category` should be "dev", "peer", or "optional". However, if the
`category` contains a space, such as "dev install", argument splitting occurs.
As a result "dev" and "install" are separate arguments, changing the meaning of
the command to installing the package `list` instead of listing dependencies.
This is because the following will be executed:

```javascript
execSync("npm --omit dev install list");
```

## Shell Injection

A _shell injection_ or _command injection_ vulnerability occurs when untrusted
user input is used in the construction of a command in an insecure way. This
allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the target system, leaving it
vulnerable to a myriad of attacks.

The following snippet is an example of this type of vulnerability

```javascript
import { execSync } from "node:child_process";

const stdout = execSync(`echo 'Hello, ${name}!'`);
console.log(stdout);
```

an attacker could pick as `name` a malicious value in order to execute a command
of their choosing. For example `';whoami;echo '` would leak the current user.
This is because the following will be executed:

```javascript
const stdout = execSync("echo 'Hello, ';whoami;echo '!'");
console.log(stdout);
// Outputs: 'Hello,\njohn-doe\n!'
```
